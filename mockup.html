                <h4>Come To Queensborough Community College This Summer!</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accelerate toward your degree</li>
                    <li>Improve your grade point average</li>
                    <li>Lighten your course load during the academic year</li>
                    <li>Take a course that might not be available during other semesters</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Why QCC Summer Sessions?</b></p>
                <p><b>Course Selection &#8212;</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Queensborough offers four convenient Summer Sessions with over 100 course sections to help you fulfill general education and core major requirements. Study abroad opportunities are also available.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Outstanding Faculty &#8212;&#160;</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instructors are passionate about their subjects, adept at structuring engaging, interactive learning, and committed to helping their students succeed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Small Class Size &#8212;</b></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Small classes allow you to build collegial relationships with your classmates and professor. The quality of interactions in class is consistently identified by both students and faculty as one of the best parts of their summer term experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Single Focus &#8212;</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because you'll only take one or two classes at a time, you can master difficult material by focusing your studies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Intensive Format &#8212;</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Summer Sessions are ideal for learning subjects that require intense study or focused rehearsal, such as foreign languages and public speaking. Long class meetings and short breaks between classes help you retain information better and use class time more effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Academic Excellence &#8212;</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Queensborough is a top choice for a quality and affordable education, and our Summer Session courses meet the high academic standards we set for the regular academic year.</li>
                </ul>
