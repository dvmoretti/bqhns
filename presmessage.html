      <p style="text-align:right;">Holy Week 2015<br />
      &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">&ldquo;But the angel spoke  and said to the women,<br>
        do not be afraid; for I know that you seek<br>
        Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here, for<br>
        He has risen even as he said. Come see the<br>
        Place where the Lord was laid. Go quickly,<br>
        tell his disciples that He has risen;<br>
        and behold, he goes before you to Galilee;<br>
        there you shall see him.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>With that quote from scripture, I recall a sermon that was  given by a good Old Irish Priest by the name of Monsignor William Costello. On  Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week, he said &ldquo;this week, Holy Week is our Super  Bowl.&rdquo; He was so right. This week, the ceremonies that take place on Holy  Thursday, Good Friday, &amp; Holy Saturday, are ancient, spiritual, and  beautiful.</p>
      <p>On Holy Thursday we celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s Supper where for  the first time He consecrated the bread and wine. We also see Christ&rsquo;s example  of humility by washing the feet of his disciples. Holy Thursday is also the  anniversary of the Priesthood. To all of our Priests, &ldquo;Ad Multos Annos&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>On Good Friday, we hear the Passion of the Lord as we did on  Palm Sunday. A cross, covered with a red cloth is brought into the church and  elevated. Each arm of the cross is exposed as the Priest chants, &ldquo;this is the  wood of the cross on which hung the Savior of the world.&rdquo; The faithful respond,  &ldquo;come let us worship.&rdquo; We then venerate the cross by kneeling before it and  touching it with either our hands or our lips. Today we look to the cross as  the visible sign of Christ&rsquo;s suffering, knowing he gave his life for us.</p>
      <p>On Holy Saturday, the church is dark, except for the Easter  fire, which is blessed and then used to light the Easter candle and all of the  candles held by those assembled. The Exulted is proclaimed, &ldquo;This is the night  that Jesus broke the chain of death. Rejoice and sing, for Jesus the Christ is  risen.&rdquo; I remember a Priest once preaching at the Easter Vigil and exclaimed,  &ldquo;Tonight in every church in the world, because of Jesus&rsquo; Resurrection, death  has been conquered. Life has conquered death.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>My fellow Holy Name member, Easter is more than new clothes,  baskets of candy, and a nice dinner. It is the foundation of our faith. It is  our hope for eternal life with God and our loved ones. This &ldquo;Holy Week&rdquo;, we  enter into Christ&rsquo;s passion, suffering, and death, to end up in celebrating his  rising from the dead. Just the thought of it should send chills up your back.</p>
      <p>May you and your family experience the hope and love that  our Lord&rsquo;s Resurrection offers to us all. May you all have a Holy and Blessed  Easter!</p>
<p>Fraternally,<br />
